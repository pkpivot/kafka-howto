# kafka-howto
Set of examples for using Kafka from Spring

See the Kafka for Developers articles on how to use this repository on [Medium](https://medium.com/@paul-the-kelly). The original articles used Java 8 and this code is now in the `java8` branch. The `main` branch will be used for newer Java versions. 

Currently building using Java 21. 

This repository was originally at <https://github.com/cyberycon/kafka-howto> but this is now the live version and the original repository will no longer be updated. 

Changed.
